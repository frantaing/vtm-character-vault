Proud nobles who command the very essence of darkness and shadow, to the point of worshipping it, some say. The Lasombra exist for their own success, fighting for personal victories rather than solely for a crown to wear or a throne to sit upon. They believe that might makes right, and are willing to sacrifice anything to achieve their goals. A clan that uses spirituality as a tool rather than seeking honest enlightenment, their fickle loyalties are currently highlighted by half their clan's defection from the Sabbat.
