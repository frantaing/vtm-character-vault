Once a clan of philosopher-kings and warrior-scholars in ancient times, the modern Brujah are often seen as rebels, punks, and iconoclasts. They harbor a deep-seated passion for the causes they adopt, whether those causes are social justice, personal freedom, or outright anarchy.

This passion is both their greatest strength and their most profound weakness. It fuels their martial and social prowess but also makes them dangerously susceptible to frenzy. A Brujah's rage is a terrifying thing to behold.
