Reviled outcasts whose blood is too weak to carry a true Clan lineage, the "Duskborn" walk the razor’s edge between life and unlife. Viewed by superstitious elders as the heralds of Gehenna, they are frequently hunted, branded, and barred from polite Kindred society. Lacking the raw power of the ancients, they survive through desperate adaptability and the volatile innovation of Thin-Blood Alchemy. They are the ultimate underdogs: scorned as runts, yet possessing a resistance to the sun and a connection to humanity that may make them the most evolved predators of the modern nights.
