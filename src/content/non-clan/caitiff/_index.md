Social pariahs and unwanted orphans, the Caitiff are the Clanless who manifest no distinct lineage or were abandoned by their sires. Viewed as mistakes or bad omens by high society, they lack the protective structure and inherent talents of the great Clans. Yet, their blood is uniquely free; they suffer no specific Bane and are bound by no ancient traditions. Scavengers and survivors by necessity, the Caitiff must carve their own destiny in a world that wishes they did not exist.
