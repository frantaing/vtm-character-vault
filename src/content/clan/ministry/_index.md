Formerly Followers of Set. A religious movement that evangelizes the example of a chthonic god, while seeking out the world’s secret places and protecting ancient artifacts. Orthodox Setite belief dictates that Set will one day return to rule or consume the world, and devout Setites prepare the way for his resurrection. To this end, the clan remains independent of the sects of other Kindred, and practice with great skill the arts of corruption, deceit and ancient sorcery. They refer to themselves as the Mesu Bedshet, the "Children of Rebellion".
