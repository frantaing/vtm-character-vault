Hideously disfigured by the Embrace, so they keep to the sewers shadows and traffic in the secrets they collect. The archetypal Nosferatu resembles Max Shreck's Count Orlok, though the curse has any number of variations. The Nosferatu are the spymasters of the dead, collecting information and selling it for a dear price. They are also the masters of the underground, living in the sewers for protection.
