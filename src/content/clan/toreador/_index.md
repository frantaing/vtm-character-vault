Cainites that enjoy every sensual pleasure the world has to offer, idolizing physical beauty and the adoration of their thralls. The Degenerates are responsible for the legends of vampires who seduce and entice their prey with beauty, love and sensuality. Famous and infamous as a clan of artists and innovators, they are one of the bastions of the Camarilla, as their very survival depends on the facades of civility and grace on which the sect prides itself.
