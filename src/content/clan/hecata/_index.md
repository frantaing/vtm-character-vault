They are not a fully organic clan deriving from a single Antediluvian and an uninterrupted bloodline, but are made up of the Giovanni and the remnants of the old Clan Cappadocian, and their respective bloodlines—as well as the Nagaraja, despite their lack of connection with Cappadocius' lineage, they represent a new, (mostly) unified Clan of Death comprising Kindred bloodlines who practice necromancy through the use of Oblivion. Much like the Giovanni that it almost entirely subsumes, it is also a family, albeit a much more extended one.

With the Banu Haqim joining the Camarilla, the Ministry joining the Anarchs, and the Ravnos greatly diminished, the Hecata are the last independent clan of significance in contemporary nights.
