# Vampire: The Masquerade Character Vault

Welcome to my personal VtM Character Vault! This project started as a way for me to reference (and ponder) my characters/NPCs from any device, and as an excuse to learn React. It's a passion project that finally centralizes all my errant characters into one place.

This is a simple, wiki-esque collection of my characters (mostly V20), organized by clan, bloodline, or status (Caitiff/Thin-Blood). Each character has their own page with their character sheet, notes, images, and other details, all rendered dynamically from Markdown files.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently under construction! Probably a little rough around the edges, and I haven't even added a single character aside from the test/placeholder, but I figured I'd just get the future pain of deployment out of the way and relish in the knowing that it does, indeed, work.
